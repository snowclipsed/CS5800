# Problem Set 2

## 1) $T(n)=2T(\frac{2}3n)+n^2$

### 1.2) Give asymptotic upper bounds using Master Method



The master method can be described through the form :
$$
T(n) = aT(n/b) +f(n)
$$
Fitting the constants $a$ and $b$ into the given equation from the question we can conclude : 

We have a number $ a = 2 $ subproblems, each dividing the root input	 into $b = 3/2$.

Now, $log_\frac{2}{3}(2) = 1.70951129$

let $\epsilon = 0.1$

Now, $ \because n^2 > n^{log_\frac{2}{3}(2)+0.1} \Rightarrow n^2 > n^{1.80951..}$

This falls under **case 3** of the master theorem. This means that $f(n) = \Omega(n^{log_\frac{2}{3}(2)+0.1})$ so $T(n) = \Theta(f(n))$

Since we have discovered the tight bound on $T(n)$, the upper bound $O(n)$ will be the same as the tight bound.
