# Problem Set 2

## Question 1.1)

We can draw the recursion tree as :

When we have reduce the tree down to individual elements, we have k levels in the tree.

A singular element can be represented as : $(\frac{2}3)^kn = 1$

Which means $k = log_{3/2}(n)$

The total cost of all the levels can be represented as : 

$T(n) = \sum^{i=k}_{i=0} 2^i(\frac{2}{3})^in^2 \Rightarrow n^2 \sum^{i=k}_{i=0} (\frac{4}{3})^i$

$T(n) = n^2 + 2 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2n^2 + 4 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3n^2 + \ldots$

Since the dominant term is $n^2$, we can argue that the overall order is $O(n^2)$
