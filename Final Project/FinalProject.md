# Project Context

**Through the eyes of Hardik Bishnoi :**

As the global landscape becomes increasingly interconnected, international students often find themselves exploring new and diverse experiences in unfamiliar territories. From my own experience, stepping into foreign lands with limited resources commanded high-level resource optimization to deal with cultural, geographical, and financial challenges. One can say that such an experience is no different from a hitchhiker trying to explore new lands with confined resources. Our final project for algorithms is to model such a scenario with a hitchhiker and understand how various variables affect optimal route planning. I have always been interested in how various algorithms can actually be put into practical path planning [1]. I want to utilize the knowledge I have gained about various algorithms in class by implementing this model and understand the nuances of implementation.

As an individual deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and human experiences, I find profound personal relevance in our project, which focuses on optimizing travel routes for hitchhikers. Drawing parallels to the hitchhiker's quest to explore diverse places while minimizing costs, I see this project as a mirror to the intricate dance of balancing constraints and optimizing outcomes. This endeavor resonates with my curiosity for efficient systems and aligns with my belief that technology can significantly enhance personal experiences. It serves as an invaluable opportunity to delve into the complexities of route optimization, akin to the hitchhiker strategically navigating their path. Additionally, the implementation of concepts learned in class and understanding their real-world applications excites me, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical solutions. Moreover, I am confident that the skills and insights gained from this project will undoubtedly fortify my pursuit of another project idea, focusing on the seamless and personalized integration of daily tasks with travel experiences. Like every hitchhiker with a unique story, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the narrative of our project, weaving together the threads of exploration, efficiency, and the human element in travel.

**Through the eyes of Saanidhya Vats:**

In our lives, particularly when we embark on a journey as tourists to a new destination, our expectations for exploring the city can vary significantly. Some individuals aspire to visit every renowned landmark swiftly, while others prefer a more leisurely exploration of fewer places. Some aim to navigate the city in a manner that minimizes overall travel costs. Given that everyone is unfamiliar with the new surroundings, pursuing specific objectives becomes challenging. Our project seeks to address this challenge by offering diverse routes tailored to individuals based on their available resources and specific goals. This solution is not only beneficial for tourists but also extends its utility to students, like ourselves, who are newcomers to a city. Students often wish to discover the city while managing their finances or earning some additional income. As a student, this project holds significant relevance for us.



**Through the eyes of Hakshay Sundar:**

As a student, like many others, I too have a limited amount of resources and the hope to explore more of the world around me. Thinking of which, a hitch-hiker comes to mind, exploring at random the various places around them and finding ways to maximize their resources. Doubling down on that thought, I could relate to a few more processes such as: a CPU scheduling tasks while taking into consideration a wide range of constraints and working to optimize the output; animals moving from one place to the other in the hopes of increasing their food supply, potentially staying in a warmer climate, etc... This project allows me a chance to try and understand these operations more closely to some extent all while giving me a chance to model my hope of traveling around and exploring more of this pale blue dot — Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan.



# Question

How would a hitchhiker on a road trip plan an optimal journey to manage their resource?

- maze structure
- algorithm
- weight costs (random or selected)
- different kinds of weights
  - attractiveness of a node : whether the hitchhiker wants to stay at a node for longer etc
  - mode of transport available including time constraint
- if hitchhiker can see the nodes or not
- detect dead ends
- end conditions:
  - explore maximum nodes with minimum resources spent
- graph and document results
